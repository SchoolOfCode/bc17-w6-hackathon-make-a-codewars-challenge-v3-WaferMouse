## Story

Christmas will be here before you know it, but you don't have a Christmas tree! Fortunately there's one hidden in this function. Unfortunately it got turned into numbers and buried in letters. It should look like this:

```
    #    
   ###   
  #####  
 ####### 
#########
    #    
  #####  
   ###   
```
The test will pass the following text to the function, try to pull the tree out of it, and make sure that it's made out of `#`s.

## Plan

- Install dependencies âœ…
- Write a barebones test to check the environment âœ…
- Write a test âœ…
- write function skeleton âœ…
- Write a basic solution (cheat by copying and pasting the expected output in) âœ…
- Write a better solution that's more fun! âœ…

Overview: Find the Christmas tree in a pile of numbers and letters  

## Reflections
- Had to figure out how to include line breaks in the string ðŸ¤”
- Initially forgot to handle the line breaks in my solution ðŸ˜‚
- Added a vscode extension to enable overwrite typing to make preparing the strings easier
- Earlier feedback may have been better
