## Story

Christmas will be here before you know it, but you don't have a Christmas tree! Fortunately there's one hidden in this function. Unfortunately it got turned into numbers and buried in letters. It should look like this:

```
    #    
   ###   
  #####  
 ####### 
#########
    #    
  #####  
   ###   
```
The test will pass the following text to the function, try to pull the tree out of it, and make sure that it's made out of `#`s.
