Christmas will be here before you know it, but you don't have a Christmas tree! Fortunately there's one hidden in this function. Unfortunately it got turned into numbers and buried in letters. It should look like this:

    #    
   ###   
  #####  
 ####### 
#########
    #    
  #####  
   ###   

The test will pass the following text to the function, try to pull the tree out of it, make sure that it's made out of `#`s and return it from the function.

TIP
***

Remember that line breaks are not letters OR numbers! It might help for you to write additional helper functions.

Make sure you run npm install before you start!
